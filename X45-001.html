                    <p>NAME: X45-001 Czar'Krang Colossus</p>
                    <p>DESCRIPTION: Class-E planet</p>
                    <p>2019: The year of discovery</p>
                    <p>TERRAIN AND CLIMATE:</p>
                    <p>The original surface before terraforming was lava base rock, with some ongoing volcanic activity. <br>
                        Before atmospheric processing began, its atmosphere was reported by CM-88B Mortzestus crew member Ash to be primordial and inert, containing nitrogen, high concentration of CO2 crystals, methane and trace elements. Dust and turbulence created a murky atmosphere with little surface light and poor visibility. Originally the atmosphere at the surface was deep cold.</p>
                    <p>MASS RADIUS AND TEMPERATURE:</p>
                    <p>The apparent inclination of X45-001's orbit has not yet been measured. The minimum mass of X45-001 b is 1.27 M⊕, which would be the actual mass if its orbit were seen edge on from the Earth. Once its orbital inclination is known, the mass will be calculable. More tilted orientations imply a higher mass, with 90% of possible orientations implying a mass below 3 M⊕. The planet's exact radius is unknown. If it has a rocky composition and a density equal to that of the Earth, then its radius is at least 1.1 R⊕. It could be larger if it has a lower density than the Earth, or a mass higher than the minimum mass. Like many super-Earth sized planets, X45-001 could have an icy composition like Neptune, with a thick layer of hydrogen on its surface; the likelihood that this is the case has been calculated to be greater than 10%. The planet has an equilibrium temperature of 234 K (−39 °C; −38 °F).</p>
                    <p>ORBIT:</p>
                    <p>X45-001 orbits its host star every 11.186 days at a semi-major axis distance of approximately 0.05 astronomical units (7,000,000 km; 5,000,000 mi), which means the distance from the exoplanet to its host star is one-twentieth of the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Comparatively, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, has a semi-major axis distance of 0.39 AU. X45-001 receives about 65% of the amount of radiative flux from its host star that the Earth receives from the Sun - for comparison Mars receives about 43%. Most of the radiative flux from X45-001 is in the infrared spectrum. In the visible spectrum the exoplanet receives only ~3% of the PAR (400-700 nm) of Earth irradiance - for comparison Jupiter receives 3.7% and Saturn 1.1%. So it would usually not get much brighter than twilight anywhere on X45-001's surface. The maximum illumination of horizontal ground by twilight at sunrise is about 400 lux, while the illumination of X45-001 is about 2700 lux with quiet X45-001. Also, X45-001 has flares. The brightest flare observed till 2019 had increased the visual brightness of X45-001 about 8 times, which would be a large change from the previous level but, at about 17% the illumination of Earth, not very strong sunlight. However, because of its tight orbit, X45-001 receives about 400 times more X-ray radiation than the Earth does. According to a yet-to-be-published article, a March 2019 flare reached about 68 times usual level, thus a little brighter than the Sun.</p>
