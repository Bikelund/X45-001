                        <p>REMARKS:</p>
                        <p>Subject entered employment with I.Q. level 8.7 and GMA personality matrix of level 7. Performance ratings exceed average readings of warrant officers in fleet. Due to highly motivated bio-environmental factors in subject’s childhood, prognosis for promotion to highest rank obtainable is probable. Based on Torin brain overscan analysis and psychometric study, suggest that subject be given long-range cryo duty on heavy transports and freighters until reaching minimum logged miles requirement for promotion to operating officer, then transfer to flagship fleet. Performance potential may reach 9.5, based on initial performance and ratings.</p>
                        <p>AMENDMENT: (2/14/28)</p>
                        <p>Subject violated bylaw 87-B of company regulations by allowing natural pregnancy to come to term during a layover between hauls. After a committee review of the situation, subject was allowed to continue employment under certain mutually agreed upon condition (outlined in subject’s contract, under File RIP/WBM-180eu7678).</p>

                        <p>Subject began assignment with company with a level 8 I.Q. and level 6 personality GMA. Throughout subject’s assignments I.Q. remained at entry level, whereas there was a marked decrease in GMA. Preliminary assessment of psych profile indicates subject’s hostility to authority had been sublimated in such a way as to cause a mild psychosis related to performing executive officer duties. Since the subject’s GMA should have risen with escalation of rank, it was determined that a retesting and orientation treatment was due. However, continuity in employment was disrupted 2/17/34.</p>

                            8/16-6/18 <br>

                        <p>REMARKS:</p>
                        <p>Subject is Despin Convert at birth (male to female). So far no indication of suppressed traumas related to gender alteration. Subject’s I.Q. at level 4.6 GMA personality at 4.2. Indicates that subject’s social counts are too low for large crew, up mode status, and has been routinely assigned small crew cryosleep mode duties which have been performed adequately.
                            Slight hyperactivity and nervousness diagnosed and Loxy-Clav M (oral ingestion) has been successful as self-administered treatment.
                            Moderate intelligence and performance abilities did not substantially increase after security patrol navigation duties and subject was therefore re-assigned long range cryosleep duties on cargo transports and tugs. Current assessment indicates subject should not be upgraded until after extensive full range DBQ testing and Frakes-Stephen orientation is applied.
                            Above was never acted upon due to employment discontinuity which occurred 2/17/34 cf. Document 81 under file BG97-G</p>

                        <p>REMARKS:</p>
                        <p>Subject began assignment with company with a level 7.3 I.Q. and a level 5 personality GMA. Throughout subject’s assignments both figures remain constant. Subject’s history related to not achieving medical degree is quoted more fully in file coded Psych. 6875-BM. Summarized: Subject is highly idealistic overachiever, type A personality (level 18.7) with a biomedical overcount which interferes with concentration and performance without medication. Under pressure at medical school, subject abused medication (Dylop-Chronium 47) and caused an embolism which hospitalized subject for 107 days. After psych. reorientation at Man Hadley’s medical clinic, subject responded to career therapy and chose to study for a commercial pilot’s licence. After achieving it, subject became an executive officer on a British Hospital ship but again succumbed to drug abuse and was removed from position for re-evaluation. After diagnosing subject as a Hunter-Selmon personality variation of type A, Dylop-Chronium 47 treatment was concluded and was replaced with Carothene Matrix A concentrates. Subject may self-medicate with commercially-made alcohol. Tendencies to alcoholism countered with daily consumption of Selway Digression molecule binders (SDMBs). This treatment proved successful and subject was rated operational for duty again. After grueling duty as captain of a medical tug, subject asked for transfer away from medicine related jobs and went into merchant transport assignments. Because subject began to lower GMA count and reduce self-induced stress factors, performance and concentration increased and subject achieved higher rank and responsibility. WARNING: Subject still exhibits high level of idealism and at this time his impulsiveness makes him a poor candidate for full command. Recommended that further diagnosis should be undertaken before upgrading subject further.</p>

                        <p>Subject’s I.Q. count of 4.3 and GMA personality Matrix count of 6.2 indicated a slightly unhealthy mixture of sublimated hostility to authority and environmentally suppressed intelligence. Subject’s counts did not substantially alter throughout span of employment, with an exception of a 0.2 rise in I.Q. count due to oral inception of intelligence booster Dramox-222. Early mechanical aptitude has borne out limited education in FTL and sub-FTL rocketry maintenance and computer-assisted facilities assessment. Performance ratings were constantly at an average of 13-15% below the Lucan-Miller Curve for Company maintenance per fleet records for the period of subject’s employment, indicating an increase of Dramox treatment and psych. orientation were long overdue. However discontinuity in employment occurred 2/17/34. cf. Document 81 under File BG97-G.</p>

                        <p>REMARKS:</p>
                        <p>Subject entered employment with an I.Q. count of 4.1 and GMA personality matrix count of 5.3. Near discontinuity of employment, I.Q. dropped to 4.0, while GMA rose to 5.6. Indicates subject began acclimating to company duties and social environment. Performance quotients remained just within expected ratings based on subject’s bio-environmental influences. Subject exhibited passive response to violent childhood memories when given the Steiner/Korngold GMF Analysis, which indicates reversal and sublimation of hostility. In subject’s case, condition requires no external treatment strategies because self-adjustment had been obtained during company training procedures and due to friendship formed between subject and another company employee (Parker, NOC-G1/409665209053-779). Passivity behavior can be a positive factor on extended up mode transits. Subject’s performance ratings remained static throughout company assignment. SPECIAL NOTE: Subject was remanded to company employment from U.S. Federal Rehabilitation Program for Displaced Youth, or FREPDISY/subject committed a level 8 felony when 17 (cf. File JJ-Psych 998338383-GH) and after immediate bio-social reform systems proved successful, was transported to ICC Trade School, (Mars Campus) and passed all courses with moderate achievement ratings. Due to ICC bylaws in this circumstance, subject can not be promoted until full review and evaluation has been completed by a combination of FREPDISY and ICC agencies. Employment was interrupted on 2/17/34. cf. Document 81 under File BG97-G</p>
